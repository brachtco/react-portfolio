# Danny Bracht React Portfolio

## Descripton

I have created a portfolio with React, which showcases two team 
project apps (Know Your Music and The Mealer Dealer).

The portfolio has a Header, Navigation Bar and a Footer,
along with an About Me, Contact and Portfolio pages. The
Portfolio page has two images which link to the deployed,
functioning apps.

This is a work-in-progress and I will be adding a third
team  project as well as more enhancements.
